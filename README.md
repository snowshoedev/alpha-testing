# Snowshoe.dev - Your Slack Knowledge Curator

## Why Snowshoe?

Having been employed within our Slack channel for months, we believe it's an opportune moment to share it with teams of a similar profile, specifically early-stage tech startup development teams, to gauge its utility.

More than 80% of developer team knowledge is scattered across different platforms (Slack threads, GitHub issues, etc.). We build Snowshoe as an automated knowledge curator to aggregate and transform such information from unstructured formats into a Q&A knowledge base.

## How to install Snowshoe?

### Setup

Takes ~3 minutes and includes the following steps:

- Install Snowshoe Slack app
- Invite Snowshoe to Slack channels
- Start curating Slack threads into knowledge!

### A. Install Snowshoe Slack app

Please visit https://snowshoe.dev/slack/install to install Snowshoe as a Slack app (we are currently in the early alpha stage so not published in the official Slack store yet). Click `Add to Slack` to install Snowshoe. Choose the desired Slack workspace on th top right.

üí° Only **workspace admin** is authorized to install Snowshoe at this moment.

Once the backend processing finishes (usually takes ~10-20s), Snowshoe should DM you a link to the knowledge card. Clicking into the link, you can view the curated knowledge of this thread by Snowshoe. You can also browse more knowledge cards returning to the homepage.
